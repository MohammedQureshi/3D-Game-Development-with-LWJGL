# 3D-Game-Project
In this project I went for a more advanced approach as I started looking into 3D games and seeing how everything worked on a 3 way coordinate system and for this project I used the library LWJGL and used the help of online tutorials to understand how everything worked and then going onto creating extra things using the current knowledge I have.
